![Devil’s Fiddle](/fiddle.jpg)

there is a painting i keep coming back to, of the devil playing a fiddle. i never cared much for its original meaning, but the image stayed with me. it feels like a mirror of how i approach sharing my own thoughts. every time i think of writing, the fiddle starts playing, a tune of doubts and overthinking. i get caught between noise and silence, tempted to speak but holding back.

for a long time i stopped writing online. i got bored of twitter, the arguments, the bait posts, and the sense that nothing i said mattered. silence was easier.

but over time i realized i needed a space outside of work. something to track what i was learning, the side projects i tried, and the progress i made beyond the routine of a full-time job.

a few months back, i picked up a notebook again. not everything went into it, just fragments, a word, a sentence, an idea i did not want to lose. slowly, those scraps began to add up. writing gave me a sense of grounding i did not expect.

as ai is everywhere now, and i often catch myself leaning on it for the smallest tasks. sometimes i feel it makes me dumb, even strips away the urge to think for ourselves. that is why i want to keep reading and writing. they make me feel alive in ways no tool can.

that painting means something else entirely. but for me, the devil’s fiddle is a reminder that the doubts will always play their tune. writing here is my way of choosing not to dance to it. maybe this is why i love art. a painting can mean one thing to the world and something entirely different to me. that is the beauty of art, and of writing too. once it is out in the world, it carries new meanings with every reader.

this is a beginning and my way of leaving something behind that might someday mean more than i intended. one of these days, i will be as good as the people i look up to. even if i do not quite make it, i will not feel any remorse. i will cherish the process.
